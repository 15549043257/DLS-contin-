# CONTINIZER

This is a python graphical interface for the popular inverse Laplace transform program called CONTIN by Provencher.
This is not a reimplementation of CONTIN. 

it is merely an interface that makes a call for Contin and therefore requires a working version.
The Fortran source code for Contin is freely available at:
http://s-provencher.com/contin.shtml

A compiled version is provided in this reposity that might work for you if you have a Windows system.
