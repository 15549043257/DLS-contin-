To run the software you will need the following things.

1) python 2 installation with all the necesary libraries. I suggest you download python(xy) which includes everything. http://python-xy.github.io/
	Make sure you install pyqt, numpy and matplotlib.
2) Dll's to run the contin. They should be in the same folder as the continizer.
3) Continizer python code and a few setting files explained in the 'manual'
